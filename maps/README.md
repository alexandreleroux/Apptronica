Improving the map
--------------------------

BACKGROUND<br>
Map data, such as the location of Apptronica members, can be stored in a GeoJSON file. This file format is [automatically displayed over a map by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github).

Improving the file that contains the map data:
* Register and login to [GitHub](http://github.com)
* Copy the [raw members_map.geojson](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Apptronica/raw/master/maps/members-map.geojson) data to [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)
* Edit the map content using the 'Table' view<br>
** Add text and links<br>
** Add new member locations
* Go to the [members_map.geojson file](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Apptronica/blob/master/maps/members-map.geojson) and click 'Edit this file', then copy your improved geojson from the '</> JSON' tab and copy this content to the the members-map.geojson
* Indicate what you added or changed in the 'Commit changes' box and click the 'Commit changes' button

Bravo, you're done! Once I'll accept your changes (aka 'pull request'), the map will be updated and all other users will see the improvements you've done.


Privacy warning
-------

* Please only add the city where you live in, not the exact address - that's probably something you don't want to make accessible here to everyone in the Universe


To do
-----

* Time is the only limit! If you have ideas, let's discuss... we can probably make this map a bit more useful :)
