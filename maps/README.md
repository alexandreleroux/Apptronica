Improving the map
--------------------------

BACKGROUND<br>
Map data, such as the location of Apptronica members, can be stored in a GeoJSON file. This file format is [automatically displayed over a map by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github).

Improving the file that contains the map data:
* Register and login to [GitHub](http://github.com)
* Copy the [raw members_map.geojson](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Apptronica/raw/master/maps/members-map.geojson) data to the [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) '</> JSON' tab
* Click on the 'Table' tab to edit the map content using the 'Table' view<br>
 * Add new members by searching for its location (the magnifying glass icon) and then clicking the pushpin to place the marker on the map<br>
 * Add corresponding text and links in the Table view
* Go to the [members_map.geojson file](https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Apptronica/blob/master/maps/members-map.geojson) and click 'Edit this file' (the little pen icon), copy your improved geojson from the '</> JSON' tab on geojson.io and copy this content to members-map.geojson on GitHub
* Indicate what you added or changed in the 'Commit changes' box and click the 'Commit changes' button

Bravo, you're done! Once I'll accept your changes (aka 'pull request'), the map will be updated and all other users will see the improvements you've done.


Privacy warning
-------

* Please only add the city where you live in, not the exact address - that's probably something you don't want to make accessible here to everyone in the Universe


To do
-----

* Time is the only limit! If you have ideas, let's discuss... we can probably make this map a bit more useful :)
